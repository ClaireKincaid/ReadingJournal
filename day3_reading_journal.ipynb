    "\n",
    "Note: the exercise numbers below match up with the reading for ease of cross referencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.1 A string is a sequence\n",
    "- a string is a sequence of characters\n",
    "- you can access characters one at a time with the bracket operator\n",
    "     fruit = 'banana'\n",
    "     letter = fruit[1]\n",
    "- expression in brackets is an index-- indicates which character in sequence you want\n",
    "- index is offset from the beginning of the string, first letter in string is letter 0, not letter 1\n",
    "- use any expression as an index, but the value of the index has to be an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "8.2 len\n",
    "- len is a built in function that returns the number of characters in a string\n",
    "- len is always one more than the index of the last letter, since index begins at 0\n",
    "- use negative indices, count backwards from end of string\n",
    "\n",
    "8.3 traversal with a for loop\n",
    "- computations involve processing a string one character at a time\n",
    "- traversal: pattern of processing that starts at the beginning of a sequence of characters and does something to each character until they reach the end\n",
    "- you can write traversals with a while loop, or a for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "8.4 String Slices\n",
    "- a segment of a string is called a slice. \n",
    "- selecting a slice as follows\n",
    "        s = 'monty python'\n",
    "        print s[0:5]\n",
    "        Monty\n",
    "        print s[6:12]\n",
    "        Python\n",
    "- operator [n:m] returns part of string from n to m character-- inlcuding first character, excluding the last character\n",
    "- if you omit first index, slice starts at beginning of string\n",
    "- if you omit the second index, slice goes till end of string\n",
    "- if the first index is greater than/equal to the second, resutl is an empty string-- contains no characters and has length 0\n",
    "\n",
    "8.5 Strings are immutable\n",
    "- tempting to use [] operator on left side of the assignment but it does not work.\n",
    "- object: is the same thing ans a value\n",
    "- item: one of the values in a sequence\n",
    "- strings are immutable: you can't change an existing string.  the best you can do is create a new string that is a variation of the original\n",
    "\n",
    "8.6 Searching\n",
    "- function find is opposite of the [] operator. \n",
    "- takes a character and finds the index where that character occurs\n",
    "- traversing a sequence and returning when we find what we are looking for is called a search\n",
    "\n",
    "8.7 Looping and Counting\n",
    "- counter: pattern of computation where variable count is initialized to 0 and incremented each time the searched for thing is found\n",
    "- when loop is exited, count contains the total number of times the thing was found\n",
    "\n",
    "8.8 String Methods\n",
    "- method is similar to a function: takes arguments and returns a value, but syntax is different\n",
    "- method uses syntax value.method\n",
    "    ex. word = 'banana'\n",
    "        new_word = word.upper()\n",
    "        print new_word\n",
    "        BANANA\n",
    "- dot notation specifies nameof method and name of string to apply method to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8.9 The in operator\n",
    "- in is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns True if the first appears in the second (ex, true if a is in banana)\n",
    "\n",
    "8.10 String comparison\n",
    "- relational operators work on strings.\n",
    "- if two strings are equal string 1 == string 2\n",
    "- other relations are used for putting words in alphabetical order.  \n",
    "- uppercase words always come before lowercase words in python so standardize input format\n",
    "\n",
    "8.11 Debugging\n",
    "- most difficult parts of a traversal are the beginning and the end\n",
    "- print values of indices immediately before error line\n",
    "- usually your value will be out of index range because you forgot that the first word is index 0"
