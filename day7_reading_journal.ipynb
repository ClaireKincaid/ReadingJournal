    "- a dictionary is a list, but more general-- in a dictionary the indices can be almost any type\n",
    "- dictionary = mapping between a set of keys (indices) and a set of values.\n",
    "    - each key maps to a value\n",
    "    - association of a key and value = key-value pair or item\n",
    "- dict() creates new diectionary with no items\n",
    "- {} represent and empty dictionary\n",
    "- to add items to a dictionary, use square brackets\n",
    "    eng2sp = dict()\n",

    "    {}\n",
    "    eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n",
    "    print eng2sp\n",
    "    {'one':'uno\"}\n",
    "- output format is also an input format\n",
    "- 'one' is the index, 'uno' is the value, they form a key-value pair or item\n",
    "- order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable, but does not matter.  elements of dictionary are not indexed with integers-- use keys to look up corresponding values\n",
    "- if a key isn't in the dictionary, you get exception = KeyError\n",
    "- the in operator when used with dictionaries tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionar (not as value)\n",
    "    'one' in eng2sp\n",
    "    True\n",
    "    'uno' in eng2sp\n",
    "    False\n",
    "- hashtable- py algorithm where in algorithm takes same amount of time no matter how many items there are in the dictionary\n",
    "- also use 'values()' method to determine if a value is in a dictionary-- values returns the values as a list, then use in\n",
    "\n",
    "11.1 Dictionary as a set of counters\n",
    "- given a string and want to count how many times each letter appears-- 3 possibilities\n",
    "    1.) create 26 variables, traverse string and for each character, increment the corresponding counter using chained conditional\n",
    "    2.) create list with 26 elements then convert each character into a number using ord(), using the number as an index into the list and increment the appropriate couter\n",
    "    3.) create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as values.  First time you see a character, you add that item to the dictionary, after that you increment value of existing item\n",
    "- implementation: way of perofrming a computation\n",
    "- dictionary implementation means we don't have to know ahead of time letters in the string, only have to make room for letters that appear\n",
    "\n",
    "11.2 Looping and dictionaries\n",
    "- if you use the a dictionary in a for statement it traverses keys in dictionary\n",
    "- keys appear in no particular order (but you can make them if you want to)\n",
    "\n",
    "11.3 Reverse lookup\n",
    "- finding the value for a given key in a dictionary= lookup\n",
    "- there is no simple syntax for a reverse lookup, you have to search\n",

    "        raise ValueError('this value does not appear in the dictionary')\n",
    "- function = search pattern with raise\n",
    "- raise statement causes an exception-- in this case a Value Error which generally indicates that there is something wrong with the value of the parameter-- using value error causes the function, if unsuccessful to use a traceback error message\n",
    "-raise statement takes optional detailed error message as a string that will return with error \n",
    "\n",
    "11.4 Dictionaries and Lists\n",
    "- lists can appear as values in a dictionary\n",
    "- invert histogram: maps frequencies to letters\n",

    "- each time throug loop key gets a key from d and val gets corresponding val\n",
    "- if val is not in inverse, then we haven't seen it vefore so we create a new item and initialize it with \"singleton: list that cointains a single element\"\n",
    "- otherwise we append the corresponding key to the list\n",
    "- hash = function that takes a value and returns an integer\n",
    "- dictionaries use hash values to store and look up key-valule pairs\n",
    "- works fine if keys are immutable-- KEYS CANNOT BE MUTABLE\n",
    "- keys must be hashable-- mutable types aren't hashable\n",
    "- lists and dictionaries cannot be used as keys but can be used as values\n",
    "\n",
    "11.5 Memos\n",
    "- bigger the argument you provide, the longer the functiont akes to run\n",
    "- call graph for fibonacci gets larger w/ each function call frame\n",
    "- a previously computed value that is stored for later use is called a memo\n",
    "- whenever a function is called, it will check a memo (named dictionary of previously computed values)-- if value is already there it will return immediately, otherwise it will compute the new value add to dict, and return\n",
    "\n",
    "11.6 Global Variables\n",
    "- variables in main are called global because they can be accessed from any function\n",
    "- global variables persist from one function to the next\n",
    "- use global variables fro flags-- boolean variabls that indicate(\"flag\") whether a condition is true. \n",
    "- ex. verbose\n",
    "- to reassign a global_variable inside a function you have to declare the global variable vefore you use it-- initialize it outside of the function, or declare global variable within the function\n",
    "- if a global variable is mutable you can modify it without declaring it \n",
    "- you can add, remove, and replace elements of a global list or dictionary, but if you want to reassign the variable you have to declare it\n",
    "\n",
    "11.7 Long integers\n",
    "- L at end of value indicates that the result is a long integer-- type long (not applicable for python 3)\n",
    "- long integers can be arbitrarily big but as they get bigger they consume more space and time\n",
    "- mathematical operators work on long integers, and functions in math.py, in general any code that works will also work with long"

I want to know what’s the longest word and how many letters does it have?\n",

    "- The word list from [Chapter 9.1](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython010.html) Exercise 1 doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.\n",
