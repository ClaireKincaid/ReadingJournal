    "Hi everyone.  These are the exercises for the first set of readings from ThinkPython.  While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

    "- python is a high level programming language\n",
    "    much easier to program in high level language\n",
    "    shorter & easier to read\n",
    "    more likely to be correct\n",

    "- most programs written in high levle languages\n",
    "- 2 kinds of programs process highlevel to low levle program\n",
    "    interpreters: reads a program and executes it\n",
    "    compilers: reads and translates porgram before running\n",
    "        high level program = source code\n",
    "        translated program = object code or executable\n",
    "        once compiled, you can execute it repeatedly w/ no trans.\n",
    "- python is an interpreted language-- executed by interpreter\n",
    "    interactive mode: type programs and interpreter desplays res.\n",
    "        >>>> is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate ready\n",
    "    script mode: store code in file and use interpreter to execute contents of file\n",
    "        give >>>> prompt the name of the file\n",
    "- interactive mode good for small pieces of code, anything larger you want a script\n",
    "1.2 what is a program?\n",
    "- a program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation\n",
    "- input: get data from keyboard, file, or other device\n",

    "- complex tasks divided into subtasks and subsubtasks-- algorithms\n",
    "1.3 What is debugging?\n",
    "- programming errors = bugs, tracking them down = debugging\n",
    "- 3 kinds of errors: syntax, runtime, and semantic\n",
    "- syntax error-- occurs when the syntax of a program is incorrect\n",
    "    syntax = sturcture of program and rules about structure\n",
    "- runtime errors-- error does not appear until after program has started running.\n",
    "    also called exceptions because they occur when something exceptionally bad has happened\n",
    "- semantic errors: program runs completely but doesn't do the right thing\n",
    "    user problem: it will do what you told it to do, you didn't tell it the right thing\n",
    "- experimental debugging: rich, challenging and interesting programming\n",

    "    tokens: basic elements of language\n",
    "    structure: the way tokens are arranged\n",
    "- parsing: figuring out the structure of the sentence and translate\n",
    "- ambiguity: natrual languages have ambiguity, dealt with-- context clues and other information-- formal languages designed with no ambiguity. every statement has exactly 1 meaning\n",
    "- redundancy: natural languages employ lots of redundancy, are verbose-- formal languages are less redundant and more concise\n",
    "- literalness: NLs have idiom and metaphor, FLs do not\n",
    "- Poetry: used in NL for sound meaning-- do not exist in FLs\n",
    "- Prose: can be analyzed in NL but still ambiguous\n",
    "- programs: unambiguous and literal, understood entirely by analysis of tokens and structure\n",
    "1.5 The first program\n",
    "- traditionally first program you type is print \"Hello, World\"\n",
    "- print statement: displays a value on the screen\n",
    "- python 2: print 'Hello World'; python 3: print ('Hello World')\n",
    "1.6 Debugging\n",
    "- debugging brings out strong emotions-- NINJAS I will be frustrated.  I promise I don't actually despise programming or you.\n",
    "- experiment with purposefully doing things wrong to trigger errors so you know what they meann\n",
