    "You only need to read as far as section B.2 (inclusive), but feel free to go further and try more exercises if you are interested.\n",
    "B.1 order of growth\n",
    "- for large values of n, any function that contains an n2 term will grow faster than a function who's leading term is n\n",
    "- leading term is the term with the highest exponent\n",
    "- higher coefficients will make something better for small n values, but there will always be some value of n where an^2 > bn\n",
    "- same argument appliles to non leading terms.  even if the run time were n + 100000000000, A would be vetter than b for a sufficiently large n\n",
    "- algorithms with smaller leading terms are better algorithms for large problems\n",
    "- for smaller problems: crossover point where another algorithm is better-- location depends on details, so usually ignored during analysis, but don't forget it completely\n",
    "- for two with same leading order term are called equivalent even with different coefficients\n",
    "- order of growth: set of functions whos asymptotic growth behavior is considered equivalent\n",
    "- 2n, 100n, and n + 1 have equal orders of growth-- O(n), linear\n",
    "- n^2 functions belong to O(n^2) and are quadratic\n",
    "- O(1) = constant\n",
    "- O(logbn) = logarithmic for any b\n",
    "- O(n) = linear\n",
    "- O(nlogbn) = n log n\n",
    "- O(n^2) = quadratic\n",
    "- O(n^3) = cubic\n",
    "- O(c^n) = exponential for any c\n",
    "- base of logarithm doesnt matter, changing bases is equivalent of multiplying by a constant so doesnt change order\n",
    "- exponential functions belong to same order of growth regardless of base\n",
    "B.2 Analysis of Basic Python Operations\n",
    "- arithmetic operations are constant time\n",
    "- multiplication takes longer than add/subtract\n",
    "- division take longer-- but don't depend on magnitude of operands\n",
    "- indexing operations are constant time\n",
    "- for loops usually linear as long as all the operations in the body are constant time\n",
    "- sum is linear, but faster-- has smaller leading coefficient\n",
    "- for loop for adding list of strings then run time is quadratic, string concatenation is linear\n",
    "- join is faster because it is linear in total length\n",
    "- if the body of the loop is in O(n^a) then the loop is in O(n^a+1)\n",
    "    -exception: show the loop exits after constant umber of iterations-- if runs k times regardless of n's then the order is the same as the body even for large k\n",
    "- multiplying/dividing by constant k doesn't change the order of growth\n",
    "- most string and tuple operations are linear, except index and len which are constant time\n",
    "- run time of slice operations is proportional to length of output but unaffected by input\n",
    "- adding an element to the end of a list is constant time\n",
    "- removing an element from the end of a list is constant time\n",
    "- sorting a list is O(nlogn)\n",
    "- all other list methods are linear\n",
    "- run time of copy is proportional to number of elements\n",
    "- run time of update is proportional to the size of the input dictionary\n",
    "- keys, values, and items are linear since they return new lists\n",
    "- iterkeys, itervales, and iteritems are constant since they return iterators\n",
    "- all other dictionary operations and methods are constant time"
