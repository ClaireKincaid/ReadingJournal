    "Note: the exercise numbers below match up with the reading for ease of cross referencing.\n",
    "6.1: Return Values\n",
    "- some built in functions produce results-- calling function generates a value\n",
    "- all functions so far are void: their return value is None\n",
    "- fruitful functions return values: ex, area-- returns area of a circle w/ given radius\n",
    "def area(radius): \n",
    "\ttemp = math.p * radius**2\n",
    "\treturn temp\n",
    "- in fruitful functions, return statement includs and expression\n",
    "- temporary variables-- variables assigned to function and then returned w/ statement at end\n",
    "\tgood for debugging\n",
    "- multiple return statements make sense for different branches of a conditional-- but make sure all eventualities are covered, otherwise return will print none\n",
    "- abs = built in function computes absolute values\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2: Incremental Development\n",
    "- incremental development: avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time\n",
    "- make small functions and then test their syntax/semantics to make sure they do the right thing\n",
    "- build small functions on eachother to check effectiveness\n",
    "- occasionally write print statements in code-- useful for debugging, remove afterwards\n",
    "- scaffolding: code helpful for building program but not part of final product\n",
    "    personal preference: comment everything, is easier, can leave\n",
    "- Key aspects\n",
    "    1. start with working program & make small incremental changes\n",
    "     2. use temporary variables to hold intermediate values-- display and check them\n",
    "     3. once the program is working, you might want to remove scaffolding/ condsolidate expressions to compact program\n",
    "6.3 Composition\n",
    "- composition: the ability to call one function within another\n",
    "- temporary variables and scaffolding also useful.\n",
    "- make more concise with function calls\n",
    "6.4 Boolean Functions\n",
    "- functions can return booleans-- useful for hiding complicated tests in functions\n",
    "- give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions\n",
    "- used in conditional statements\n",
    "- try to avoid overdefining your boolean functions"

    "- loops used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with approximate answer and iteratively improving it\n",
    "- ex: newton's method of computing square roots\n",

    "- not easy to know an algorithm-- easier to know specific solutions\n",
    "- process of designing algorithms is interesting-- central to programming\n",
    "- things that people do naturally are the hardest to express algorithmically-- ex. natural language\n",
    "7.7 Debugging\n",
    "- debugging by bisection: split your program in two or three with a print statement and and run the program\n",
    "    if midpoint print is incorrect, problem is in first part of program, if correct, it is in second part of program\n",
